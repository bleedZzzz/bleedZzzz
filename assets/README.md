Place your astronaut GIF or preferred image in this folder and name it `astronaut.jpg` (or update `README.md` to point to a different filename).

Suggested filename: astronaut.jpg
Suggested dimensions: ~200px width for best layout

After adding the image, commit and push the file so the profile shows the image on GitHub.
